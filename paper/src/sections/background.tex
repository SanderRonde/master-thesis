\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

This case study is performed at 30MHz, specifically within the context of their software platform. This section describes the company (30MHz), their software platform (the dashboard) and the problem that is solved by the case study.

\subsection{The Company}\label{sec:bg-thecompany}
30MHz is a technology company in the agriculture industry. They offer sensors that collect various types of data, all within the context of agriculture. For example temperature, humidity, air pressure etc. They also provide their customers with a dashboard that allows them to view the collected data.

\subsubsection{Dashboard}\label{sec:bg-dashboard}
The 30MHz dashboard is a web app that, as of this case study, is using Angular 10. It fetches data from a backend and displays the various types of data in different ways using so-called widgets. For example single value widgets display just the last measured value for a given sensor in order to provide the user with information at a quick glance. On the other hand, charts display the measured values as they change over a time range, allowing for patterns and anomalies to become apparent. These are just a few of the available widgets.
