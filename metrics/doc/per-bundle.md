## Will be the same between source and design library

-   Structural dependency - The number of import statements
-   Cyclomatic complexicity - Number of branches
-   Lines of code
-   Maintainability
-   Number of components - The total number of components in the bundle

## Does not apply

-   Completeness - How well it fulfills its purpose
-   Consistency - Time taken for a full update

## Different between design libraries

-   Size - The size of the bundle
-   Latency aka load time - How fast the bundle loads
-   RenderTime - How fast an individual component renders
