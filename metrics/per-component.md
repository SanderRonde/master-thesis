## Will be the same between source and design library

-   Structural dependency - The number of import statements
-   Cyclomatic complexicity - Number of branches
-   Lines of code
-   Halstead complexity
-   Completeness - How well it fulfills its purpose

## Does not apply

-   Consistency - Time taken for a full update

## Different between design libraries

-   Latency - How fast the component resources load
-   RenderTime - How fast the individual component renders
